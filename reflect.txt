For understanding the Object-Oriented Programming and it's four basic 
aspects i.e., abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
the best way is through C++ language. After having basic Programming
experience with c language that is procedural language working on 
c++ using classes and objects was something new. 

At start it feels like why we are learning all this when we have 
c language but as time passes we starts appreciating the object 
Oriented way of Programming. We can start relating a problem to
real life problem.

As we have online mode for the delivery of the lectures, it is 
difficult for both professor and students to keep up, but I would
appreciate my professor who taught me the way of coding. Setting up 
the project, reading instructions, understanding them and transforming
them to code. This was something easy to hear but hard to develop but
watching my professor coding I was able to do well in forming the logics
for solving problems.

This semester taught me how to debug the code and how to watch on 
variables we need. After the mid-exams I was very much confident over
Debugging and Walk-through skills. All this was explained in IPC course
but I was not that much good in programming at that time but it 
feels like I can also do programming after attending this course.

Weekly workshops and quizzes helped me a lot to be on track as for
the quiz part we need to read notes and the same would be implemented 
in the workshops and thus I was able to keep up with my classes.

On top of that this project totally boost me up, I have started working
on it the day it was released. I have to look at recorded lectures,
go through the notes again and again but it was fun as I was learning
and implementing those concepts. Deadlines are always helpful to be
on the timeline and they forced me to keep working on the milestones
till I achieve the same output. 

Lectures, quizzes, workshops helped me to understand each and every 
concepts of the object Oriented paradigm and project helped we to 
implement those concepts all at one and form an application. I was
able to learn by doing projects.

Milestone 5 was the most challenging part of the project, we need to 
get data from the files, save data back to the files, this was something
similar to ipc project and it was failure for me at that time and that's
why I was afraid if I would be able to do it? But this time I was having 
experience and have given time to programming having such motivation
I started working on Milestone 5 load function was the most time taking
function, as I have to make changes to files created earlier. 

This project taught me how to break a big problem into small milestones,
also our solution may work for one milestone but we may need to update 
it if it fails for the other test cases and that is the process of 
development. Write code, clear errors, clear bugs and repeat. I can
seat for long time in front of computer screens without having any 
stress and started loving coding all thanks to this course and my 
professor.
